CODENAME: PEEPOTHINK

This Java application will do cool things with emotes found in Twitch chats...

Problem Statement:



With 50 Million daily unique visitors, TwitchTV is one of the largest video sharing websites in the world. Twitch is mostly geared towards live streaming of video game content. A major draw of Twitch is Twitch Chat, where viewers numbering from the single digits to tens or even hundreds of thousands can interact with each other and the streamer in real time - mainly through text and Twitch or 3rd-Party supported emoticons, known as Twitch Emotes.

Twitch chat is availiable as a chat replay alongside video replays, known as VODs (Videos on Demand). People viewing a Twitch VOD may want to know more about the recording without having to watch the whole thing. They want to know when a moment was particularly epic, hilarious, or cringey. This information should be available in easily digestible formats, such as graphical frequency distributions of emote usage, gleaned from the VOD. That is the purpose of this application. The development codename for this application is a reference to a deep-thinking Twitch Emote.
